# Tiny Update
![](assets/logo-60px.png)

## What is this?
Tiny Update is an updater that focuses on being easy to use while being feature rich and fast!

### Why are you recreating this?
Because when I started this project, I was still in college and have learnt a lot since then and the .NET ecosystem is not the same as back then (Very much in a good way!)

### What is currently missing?
* Update package retrieval
* Cli for making updates
* Staging
* RELEASE file creation/reading

*its likely that they is more missing but can't remember at the time of creating the readme*
